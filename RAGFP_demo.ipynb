They fulfil ecological and social requirements particularly well, ranging from climate efficiency and low water consumption to labour safety and satisfaction.\\n-\\tExclusion and negative criteria: By applying these criteria, companies, sectors or countries can be excluded from the investment universe which fail to fulfil certain ESG criteria or that violate international norms and standards according to the definitions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the OECD or the United Nations. \\n\\nThe investment team is able to define a set of ESG criteria in close co-operation with the client. Exclusion criteria and negative criteria can be used to eliminate companies that fail to meet certain ESG criteria, with positive criteria, companies can be identified, which are particularly characterised by sustainable economic development, positive products or processes. With a best-in-class approach companies are selected for the portfolio if they are leaders in their industries with respect to ecological and social standards. For a thorough ESG assessment of companies the IQS team utilizes a variety of internal and external data sources, incl. MSCI, ISS, Vigeo Eiris, and others.\\n\\nFurthermore, IQS offers research driven ESG solutions which allows to align the ESG needs of clients with the IQS multi-factor investment approach. A recent example is the work on a multi-factor low carbon solution for a UK Local Government Pension Scheme as well as a research project about temperature reduction in portfolios during the portfolio construction (Kolle, J., Lohre, H., Radatz, E., Rother, C. (2022). Factor Investing in Paris: Managing Climate change risk in portfolio construction, Forthcoming at Journal Of Investment Management.)', 'Adverse ESG momentum\\nAt the intersection of return and risk is the case of stocks that experience severe downgrades to their ESG scores. These tend to be companies that have delivered highly disappointing news that caused the market to reassess the companies’ core processes and values. Historically, IQS found evidence that these companies continue to underperform after downgrade events and based on the much higher importance attached to ESG today, the team expects this to have a greater impact going forward. IQS has therefore integrated sharp downgrades of ESG scores into its risk management and treats such stocks as exceptional. This means that for a period of at least six months, the team will disregard the calculated factor exposure of such stocks and sell them out of all strategies that are not managed to a tight tracking error. Since the inclusion of the ESG Adverse Momentum measure, several stocks have been placed on our exception list to avoid materialization of further ESG risks. ']]\n",
