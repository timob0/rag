However, while individual factors may deliver better returns than traditional market capitalization weighted benchmarks in the long run, short term drawdowns of single factors may be severe and consistently successful factor timing has proven to be challenging if not impossible. Hence, the team has very successfully been implementing broadly diversified multi-factor strategies for 40 years, seeking to capture factor premiums irrespective of the prevailing market environment and timing considerations.\\nThe first step of the investment process is the definition of the investment universe, for this strategy the global market. In addition to meeting minimum liquidity and capitalization requirements, a stock must be listed on a stock exchange that is within the benchmark universe. Furthermore, the definition of the investment universe already takes client-specific restrictions like exclusions into account. \\nIn the second step, stocks are ranked according to each stock’s attractiveness with respect to the Value, Momentum and Quality factors. These rankings are based on standardized factor signals. To achieve comparability, the process ranks within industry groups within regions, i.e., on an industry-neutral basis by region. These rankings are standardized and transformed into beta-neutral single factor model portfolios. \\nIn step three, these single factor model portfolios are weighted and combined in order to obtain an overall multi-factor model portfolio. The process applies an equal-risk contribution (ERC) weighting scheme that ensures broad factor diversification at any point in time and avoids individual factors loading up excessively on risk even in times of market stress. The resulting model portfolio is the most optimal multi-factor portfolio.\\nStep four determines a corresponding risk forecast for each stock in the universe by using a proprietary risk model based on Axioma that uses the same multi-factor building blocks as the factor model in order to provide alignment of return factor and risk view. Furthermore, portfolio constraints like maximum active weights in single stocks, countries, sectors or industries are defined.\\nIn the final step – during the portfolio construction process – the Global Enhanced portfolio is optimized to track the multi-factor model portfolio as closely as possible, subject to the portfolio constraints. This step establishes high sensitivities of the final portfolio to the factors Value, Momentum and Quality while rigorously managing risks. This explicitly includes consideration of transaction costs.

Exclusion criteria and negative criteria can be used to eliminate companies that fail to meet certain ESG criteria, with positive criteria, companies can be identified, which are particularly characterised by sustainable economic development, positive products or processes. With a best-in-class approach companies are selected for the portfolio if they are leaders in their industries with respect to ecological and social standards. For a thorough ESG assessment of companies the IQS team utilizes a variety of internal and external data sources, incl. MSCI, ISS, Vigeo Eiris, and others.\\n\\nFurthermore, IQS offers research driven ESG solutions which allows to align the ESG needs of clients with the IQS multi-factor investment approach. A recent example is the work on a multi-factor low carbon solution for a UK Local Government Pension Scheme as well as a research project about temperature reduction in portfolios during the portfolio construction (Kolle, J., Lohre, H., Radatz, E., Rother, C. (2022). Factor Investing in Paris: Managing Climate change risk in portfolio construction, Forthcoming at Journal Of Investment Management.)', 'Adverse ESG momentum\\nAt the intersection of return and risk is the case of stocks that experience severe downgrades to their ESG scores. These tend to be companies that have delivered highly disappointing news that caused the market to reassess the companies’ core processes and values. Historically, IQS found evidence that these companies continue to underperform after downgrade events and based on the much higher importance attached to ESG today, the team expects this to have a greater impact going forward. IQS has therefore integrated sharp downgrades of ESG scores into its risk management and treats such stocks as exceptional.

This approach is based on Invesco's longstanding experience in customized ESG solutions, active engagement with companies, and the Invesco proxy voting approach. IQS has enhanced its risk management by introducing a dedicated ESG exposure control for all portfolios and an adverse ESG momentum measure to restrict companies experiencing severe downgrades to their ESG scores.\n","\n","The adverse ESG momentum measure targets companies that have delivered highly disappointing news, causing the market to reassess their core processes and values. IQS has found evidence that these companies continue to underperform after downgrade events, and expects this trend to have a greater impact going forward due to the increased importance of ESG considerations. IQS treats such stocks as exceptional, disregarding their calculated factor exposure for at least six months and selling them out of strategies with tight tracking error.\n","\n","In addition to the standard ESG integration, IQS can implement individual ESG requirements in various ways, including the application of positive criteria to identify companies with excellent sustainable management, sustainable products, or processes. Exclusion and negative criteria can be used to eliminate companies, sectors, or countries that fail to meet certain ESG criteria or violate international norms and standards.\n","\n","IQS's investment team collaborates closely with clients to define a set of ESG criteria, utilizing internal and external data sources such as MSCI, ISS, and Vigeo Eiris. IQS also offers research-driven ESG solutions that align with the IQS multi-factor investment approach, such as a low carbon solution for a UK Local Government Pension Scheme and a research project about temperature reduction in portfolios during portfolio construction.\n","***********************\n","Reference answers from RFP database:\n","\n","IQS employs a fully integrated ESG investment process in managing client portfolios. This is built on longstanding experience in customised ESG solutions, active engagement with companies and the Invesco proxy voting approach. Having incorporated proprietary aspects of governance for many years (“Quality” factor), IQS additionally enhanced its risk management by introducing a dedicated ESG exposure control for all portfolios as well as an adverse ESG momentum measure to restrict certain companies. \n","Adverse ESG momentum\n","At the intersection of return and risk is the case of stocks that experience severe downgrades to their ESG scores. These tend to be companies that have delivered highly disappointing news that caused the market to reassess the companies’ core processes and values. Historically, IQS found evidence that these companies continue to underperform after downgrade events and based on the much higher importance attached to ESG today, the team expects this to have a greater impact going forward. IQS has therefore integrated sharp downgrades of ESG scores into its risk management and treats such stocks as exceptional. This means that for a period of at least six months, the team will disregard the calculated factor exposure of such stocks and sell them out of all strategies that are not managed to a tight tracking error. Since the inclusion of the ESG Adverse Momentum measure, several stocks have been placed on our exception list to avoid materialization of further ESG risks. \n","In addition to the standard ESG integration, IQS can implement individual ESG requirements in numerous respects:\n","\n","-\tPositive criteria: By applying positive criteria, companies are identified that display excellence in sustainable management and sustainable products or processes. They fulfil ecological and social requirements particularly well, ranging from climate efficiency and low water consumption to labour safety and satisfaction.\n","-\tExclusion and negative criteria: By applying these criteria, companies, sectors or countries can be excluded from the investment universe which fail to fulfil certain ESG criteria or that violate international norms and standards according to the definitions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the OECD or the United Nations. \n","\n","The investment team is able to define a set of ESG criteria in close co-operation with the client. Exclusion criteria and negative criteria can be used to eliminate companies that fail to meet certain ESG criteria, with positive criteria, companies can be identified, which are particularly characterised by sustainable economic development, positive products or processes. With a best-in-class approach companies are selected for the portfolio if they are leaders in their industries with respect to ecological and social standards. For a thorough ESG assessment of companies the IQS team utilizes a variety of internal and external data sources, incl. MSCI, ISS, Vigeo Eiris, and others.\n","\n","Furthermore, IQS offers research driven ESG solutions which allows to align the ESG needs of clients with the IQS multi-factor investment approach. A recent example is the work on a multi-factor low carbon solution for a UK Local Government Pension Scheme as well as a research project about temperature reduction in portfolios during the portfolio construction (Kolle, J., Lohre, H., Radatz, E., Rother, C.
